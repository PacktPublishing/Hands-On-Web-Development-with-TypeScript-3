## About the Video Course
Do you find it difficult to write large, sophisticated JavaScript apps and long to write scripts more easily and quickly? Then this course will help you build any web app with ease using Typescript.
This course is a perfect guide to learning the basics of TypeScript and creating simple web apps. As you know, writing large applications in JavaScript is a challenge. This course will help you overcome the difficulties and build web apps with ease. You'll learn to compile ordinary JavaScript so that the code you write in TypeScript will run in any browser that runs JavaScript. 
Next, you'll start to build an application and learn to use TypeScript to write well structured, type-safe, and scalable web front-end code. As you progress, you'll learn how to receive instant feedback on the code that you're writing in order to catch mistakes earlier in the development process. 
By the end of the course, you'll be confident enough to build the applications you want and need.
